# Bird-Call-Classification
This report builds convolutional neural network models to perform audio classification on bird calls for twelve of Seattle’s most common birds. The models are trained on spectrograms of bird calls. The aim of this study is to develop accurate bird recognition to contribute to the appreciation, study, and conservation of Seattle’s bird population. The models performed with high accuracy. The first model classified American Crows and Black-capped Chickadees with an accuracy rate of 90.9%, and the second model classified twelve bird species with an accuracy rate of 95.9%.
