# Bird-Call-Classification
This project was a fun and interesting application of using neural networks to contribute to the appreciation, study, and conservation of Seattle's diverse bird population. I built two convolutional neural network models to identify bird calls for twelve of Seattleâ€™s most common birds. The models, trained on spectrograms of bird calls, performed with high accuracy. The models performed with high accuracy; the first model classified American Crows and Black-capped Chickadees with an accuracy rate of 90.9%, and the second model classified twelve bird species with an accuracy rate of 95.9%.
